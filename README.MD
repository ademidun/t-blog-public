#t-blog

An enterprise social media application created from scratch.

Description of the application: http://tomiwa.ca/tech/t-blog.html

#Before Running on Local Server:
Some enviornment variables in config.py have been modified for security. They will need to be set according to your needs


The messages.log and some api data files have also been deleted for security. Various libraries have also been compressed or deleted for space.

The program should show you what files and libraries are missing in your command line or in your new messages.log file.
